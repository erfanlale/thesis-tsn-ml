# Integrate the fixed evaluation methodology from MinimalPSFP
# Replace any potential evaluation issues in ml_trainer.py
```

### Phase 2: Model Training Enhancement
**Goal**: Train models on the massive PSFP-scenario-IntrusionML dataset

#### 2.1 Extract Features from Production Data
```bash
cd PSFP-scenario-IntrusionML
python scripts/comprehensive_tsn_extractor.py
```
